# School Bus Monitoring and Management System
This project is part of the Introduction to Software Engineering course under my bachelor's degree in software engineering
Understood. Since you have not implemented the project yet, and you are only documenting the requirements and use case model, the README file will reflect that. Here is a sample README file for the School Bus Monitoring and Management System project:

## Project Overview
The School Bus Monitoring and Management System (SBMS) is a proposed system that aims to improve the efficiency of bus transportation and increase the satisfaction of parents for schools in Riyadh. This project focuses on specifying the requirements and UML models for the SBMS system. 
and providing a screen mockups for the system

## System Features
The SBMS system is designed to have the following key features:

1. **User Management**: The system will allow school administrators (admins) to register and manage bus drivers, parents, and buses.
2. **Bus Driver Management**: Bus drivers will be able to check-in and check-out students, view their assigned routes, and monitor the real-time location of their buses.
3. **Parent Engagement**: Parents will be able to view the real-time location of the bus carrying their child and request cancellation of scheduled pickups.
4. **Bus Monitoring**: The system will continuously update the location of the buses, providing accurate and real-time information to both bus drivers and parents.
5. **Scalability**: The system is designed to support up to 1,000 concurrent users, ensuring a seamless experience for a large number of parents and bus drivers.


## Conclusion
The School Bus Monitoring and Management System (SBMS) is a proposed solution that aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of school bus transportation services in Riyadh. By providing real-time visibility and control over bus operations, the system has the potential to improve the overall experience for both parents and school administrators.
